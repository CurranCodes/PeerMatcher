# PeerMatcher
A simple terminal-based Java application which interfaces with an SQL databse to "match peers"

The purpose of this application is to look at the similarity of profiles stored in a database and reccomend them to a user using a rudimentary reccomendary system. The more "like-interests" that the user shares with a certain profile, the more likely that profile will be reccomended to the user.

You can find a video of me demonstrating it's functionality at this URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kD3Xk8F6gI5Fd4T4YYNfCAcft72NLvcR/view?usp=sharing
